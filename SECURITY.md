## Reporting Security Vulnerabilities

We appreciate responsible disclosure of security vulnerabilities. If you discover a security issue, please follow these guidelines:

### How to Report

**Please DO NOT** report security vulnerabilities through public GitHub issues, discussions, or pull requests.

Instead, please report security vulnerabilities via **[GitHub Security Advisories](https://github.com/devops-maturity/devops-maturity/security/advisories/new)**.

### What to Include

Please provide as much information as possible:

1. **Vulnerability Description**: Clear description of the vulnerability
2. **Steps to Reproduce**: Detailed steps to reproduce the issue
3. **Impact Assessment**: Your assessment of the potential impact
4. **Suggested Fix**: If you have ideas for how to fix the vulnerability
5. **Contact Information**: How we can reach you for follow-up questions

### Response Timeline

- **Initial Response**: Within 48 hours of receiving your report
- **Confirmation**: Within 7 days, we'll confirm if the issue is a security vulnerability
- **Updates**: Regular updates every 7 days until resolution
- **Resolution**: We aim to resolve critical security issues within 30 days

## Security Updates

### Notification Process

Security updates will be communicated through:
- GitHub Security Advisories
- Release notes highlighting security fixes
- Email notifications for critical vulnerabilities (if you've reported issues before)

### Update Recommendations

We strongly recommend:
- Subscribing to our GitHub repository for release notifications
- Regularly updating to the latest stable version
- Testing security updates in a staging environment before production deployment

## Bug Bounty Program

Currently, we do not have a formal bug bounty program. However, we greatly appreciate security researchers who responsibly disclose vulnerabilities and will acknowledge their contributions in our security advisories (with their permission).
