### Responsibilities

Core maintainers are responsible for:
- Reviewing and merging pull requests
- Triaging and responding to issues
- Maintaining project roadmap and milestones
- Ensuring code quality and architectural consistency
- Managing releases and versioning
- Moderating community interactions according to the Code of Conduct

## Decision Making Process

### Regular Decisions
- **Code Changes**: Decisions on code changes are made through pull request reviews
- **Bug Fixes**: Can be decided by any core maintainer
- **Minor Features**: Require approval from at least one core maintainer
- **Documentation Updates**: Can be merged after basic review

### Major Decisions
Major decisions include:

**Process for Major Decisions:**
1. Open a GitHub Discussion or Issue for community input
2. Allow at least 7 days for community feedback
3. Core maintainers discuss and reach consensus
4. Decision is documented and communicated to the community

### Conflict Resolution
- Disagreements are discussed openly in GitHub issues or discussions
- If consensus cannot be reached, the Lead Maintainer makes the final decision
- All decisions are documented with reasoning

## Community Participation

### Contributors
Anyone can contribute to the project by:
- Reporting bugs and suggesting features
- Submitting pull requests
- Improving documentation
- Participating in discussions
- Helping other community members

### Becoming a Core Maintainer
New core maintainers can be nominated by existing maintainers based on:
- Consistent high-quality contributions over time (typically 6+ months)
- Deep understanding of the project architecture and goals
- Positive community interactions
- Demonstrated commitment to the project's values

**Process:**
1. Nomination by existing core maintainer
2. Discussion among current maintainers
3. Consensus decision by all core maintainers
4. Public announcement and repository access granted

## Communication Channels

- **GitHub Issues**: Bug reports, feature requests, and general project discussion
- **GitHub Discussions**: Community Q&A, ideas, and announcements
- **Pull Requests**: Code review and technical discussions
- **Email**: Direct communication with maintainers (xianpeng.shen@gmail.com)

## Code of Conduct Enforcement

All community interactions are governed by our [Code of Conduct](CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md).
- Minor violations: Warning and guidance
- Serious violations: Temporary or permanent ban from project participation
- Reports can be made to the maintainers privately

## Project Roadmap

The project roadmap is maintained in GitHub Projects and includes:
- Current sprint goals
- Upcoming feature development
- Long-term vision and objectives
- Community-requested enhancements

## Releases

- **Major versions** (x.0.0): Significant new features or breaking changes
- **Minor versions** (x.y.0): New features and enhancements
- **Patch versions** (x.y.z): Bug fixes and minor improvements

Release decisions are made by core maintainers following semantic versioning principles.
